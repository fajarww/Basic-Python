    "For this assignment, you will write a Python program that will allow a user (player) to play a dice rolling game. This section specifies the required functionality of the program. <strong>Only a text interface is required for this program</strong>; however, bonus marks will be given if the program would be easy to follow with clear information/error messages for the player.\n",
    "The aim of Dice Rolling Game is for a player to roll 2-6 dice multiple times in each game. Victory is achieved when the median value is the same as the mean value in a result list of the dice rolls for all rounds of the game.\n",
    "The game starts by letting the player choose a number of dice to play with and also choose the type of dice that they want to use. Playerâ€™s roll the dice multiple times, and based on the results, either win or lose. Your task is to write functions to display the main menu, a game menu, as well as other functionalities to check the game history and the win/lose status. Read the following rules and requirements for each function carefully and attempt to implement them.\n"

    "### This is a program of mini game dice roll. The main objective of this game is to roll 2-6 dices multiple times in each game. The player will win if the player can have a mean and median result of the dice for all rounds which means the player should have not lose in every round to win. But however there is no minimum round in each game, but if the player roll the dice more than ten times, it will be automatically considered lose. The player should be cautious. The player will be asked if he/she wants to continue to roll or to end the game, if the player chose to end the game, the latest result will be saved. So make sure you have a big luck to win this game...!"
